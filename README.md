# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Project Description

This project implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, where the player competes against an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, making it challenging to beat.

- **Player:** 'O'
- **AI:** 'X'

The AI is designed to play optimally, making it difficult for the player to win.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Download the `my.py` file.**
2. **Run the game using Python:**
     python my.py
## Gameplay:

The game will prompt you to enter your move as a position on the board.
Enter the row and column numbers to place your 'O'.
The AI will then make its move with 'X'.
The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.

## Project Structure
my.py: Contains the main game logic, including the Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.

## Future Enhancements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
Implement different difficulty levels for the AI.
## License
